Cors--- cross origin resource sharing 
Object of a bucket can be fetched in another bucket

Step1 : 
for e.g first bucket : manishtiwari
1)Create First S3 bucket and enable static website hosting
2)upload index.html page to see the content of index.html while hitting bucket url in browser
3)Because index.html has fetch option for extra-page.html and this file is yet not uploaded in the bucket 
so you'll see 404 error on console output and in inspect---> network 
4) upload extra-page.html in this bucket only and now error will be removed because it got the file just parallel to index.html



Step2:
for e.g second bucket : mktttttt
1) Create second bucket with name mkttttt and this will be in different region than first one.
2) remove extra-page.html from first bucket and hit the url. You will see the error message in inspect-->network
but you won't see the error on console or on browser because it is now trying to fetch the extra-page.html from another bucket.
as we have commented first fetch command and uncommented second fetch which will work as CORS.
3) enable static website hosting for this second bucket as well and pass index.html as file name 
although there is no need to upload the index.html file here
4) Upload extra-page.html and this object url be used within fetch in index.html which is present in first bucket.
5) Add bucket policy and make it public just like first bucket. 
In Policy resource arn will be updated accoring to present bucket. 
6) try to fetch object url of extra-page.html. This url should show the content of extra-page.html
7) Now enable CORS in this bucket and add below json in cors in this second bucket
8) Once above steps are done, try hitting the static website url of first bucket. It will be able to show 
the content of index.html and extra-page.html both. 
9) Congratulations, CORS (cross origin resource sharing worked).
