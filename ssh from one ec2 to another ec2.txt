Step 1:
On each server run:
ssh-keygen

Step 2:
Hit enter enter enter. You'll have two files:
.ssh/id_rsa
.ssh/id_rsa.pub

step 3:
On Server A, cat and copy to clipboard the public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
[select and copy to your clipboard]

Step 4:
ssh into Server B, and append the contents of that to the it's authorized_keys file:
cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[paste your clipboard contents]
[ctrl+d to exit]

step 5:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa private.ip.of.other.server

TroubleShooting:


Once you're logged into the EC2 instance, make sure that the ~/.ssh directory and authorized_keys file have the correct permissions
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

The ~/.ssh directory should be owned by the ec2-user:
chown ec2-user:ec2-user ~/.ssh
chown ec2-user:ec2-user ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
