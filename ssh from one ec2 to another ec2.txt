Once you're logged into the EC2 instance, make sure that the ~/.ssh directory and authorized_keys file have the correct permissions
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

The ~/.ssh directory should be owned by the ec2-user:
chown ec2-user:ec2-user ~/.ssh
chown ec2-user:ec2-user ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
